# Clojure-RPS-Client

This repo contains a TCP client for RPS (Rock, Paper, Scissors) written in the Clojure Language.

## Installation

### Leiningen

To run this code, you will need to have Clojure and Leiningen installed.

To do so, follow the instructions on this website for your corresponding operating system: https://purelyfunctional.tv/guide/how-to-install-clojure/

## Usage

Once you have Leiningen installed, open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and use the following command:

    $ lein run <hostname> <port-number>
    
Replace `<hostname>` with the hostname or IP of the server, and replace `<port-number>` with the port number of the server.

You must create two clients to properly use the program.
